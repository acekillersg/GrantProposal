\section{Author's Bio} \label{sec:bio}

Dr. He Jiong received his bachelor degree from East China University of Science and Technology (2007 ~ 2011) in China. After that, he got the PhD degree from Nanyang Technological University (2011 ~ 2016) in Singapore, where his major research interests focus on High Performance Computing (HPC) and database systems. In particular, he interests in applying HPC techniques (like GPGPU) to accelerate the performance of relational query processing and other data-related applications. He has conducted a comprehensive and systematic study on combining HPC and relational database systems by exploiting the power of emerging new hardware such as coupled CPU-GPU architectures, which has inspired the database community in building high-performance and energy-efficient data processing systems based on the next generation hardware. In 2013, he was awarded with the VLDB travel grant for his research about hash joins on coupled CPU-GPU architectures. Moreover, his research work has been published in prestigious international proceedings such as VLDB/PVLDB and ACM SIGMOD.
